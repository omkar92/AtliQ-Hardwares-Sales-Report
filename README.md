# Sales Market Report Dashboard (Excel Project)

This project contains a Sales Market Performance Report built in
Microsoft Excel for AtliQ Hardwares.

The purpose of this report is not only to visualize sales data, but also
to help the business solve key market and sales challenges such as
identifying growth opportunities, improving product performance, and
optimizing regional strategy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Business Problems Addressed & Solutions Provided

1.  **Problem**: Difficulty in identifying products driving growth
    **Solution**:
    The report highlights the Top 10 products with the highest sales
    growth from 2020 to 2021, helping management focus on high-demand
    products for future investment and marketing.

2.  **Problem**: Uneven revenue contribution across divisions
    **Solution**:
    Division-wise Net Sales comparison allows stakeholders to understand
    which divisions are underperforming and where resource allocation
    should be improved.

3.  **Problem**: Lack of clarity on best and worst selling products
    **Solution**: The quantity sold ranking helps the business:

    -   Promote top-selling products
    -   Reduce focus on low-performing inventory
    -   Improve product portfolio decisions

4.  **Problem**: Measuring the impact of newly launched products
    **Solution**:
    The New Products section tracks sales generated from new launches,
    helping evaluate whether product introductions are successful or
    need repositioning.

5.  **Problem**: Uncertainty about strongest regional markets
   **Solution**:
    Country-wise sales analysis identifies top-performing regions
    (India, NA, ROA, etc.), enabling better market expansion and
    targeted sales strategies.
